Hi Michael,

I've identified and fixed all the compilation errors you encountered. Here's what was wrong:

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing MOUNT_POINT Definition** - Added the mount point constant to filesystem.h
2. **Header Guard Issue** - Fixed the #endif without #if error in filesystem.h
3. **Function Signature Mismatches** - Aligned function declarations between .h and .c files
4. **Format String Error** - Fixed time_t format specifier (%ld â†’ %lld)
5. **TinyUSB Deprecation** - Updated to use esp_tinyusb component (new ESP-IDF requirement)

## What to Do:

1. Pull the latest changes from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Run the build again:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   ```

All compilation errors should now be resolved!

## Repository:
https://github.com/ansarirahim/esp32s3-dualusb-fw

The fixes have been committed to the main branch (commit: 781ecac).

Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

Best regards,
A.R. Ansari
