## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Enumerates as MSC
- Device will enumerate as USB Mass Storage Device on Windows and Linux
- VID/PID: Default TinyUSB values (will be customizable in future)

### ✅ Drive Visible and Functional
- Drive will be visible in File Explorer (Windows) or `lsblk` (Linux)
- Can copy 5-20 MB files without errors
- Files persist after copy and eject

### ✅ Safe Eject
- After copy + OS eject, device LED returns to idle state
- No errors in host OS
- Device can be re-accessed after eject

### ✅ Power Cycle Integrity
- Power-cycle after write preserves volume integrity
- Files survive power cycle
- Filesystem remains clean and mountable

### ✅ Build Process
- `idf.py set-target esp32s3` - Sets target
- `idf.py build` - Builds successfully
- `idf.py -p <COM> flash` - Flashes to device
- `idf.py monitor` - Shows serial logs

### ✅ Documentation
- README instructions match reality
- Wiring guide is accurate
- Test procedures are comprehensive
- Tag `v0.1.0-m1-device` exists

## Known Limitations (Deferred to M2/M3)

- ❌ USB Host Mode (MSC) - Deferred to M2
- ❌ BOOT1-based mode switching - Deferred to M2
- ❌ RGB color mapping - Deferred to M3
- ❌ File copy to external devices - Deferred to M3
- ❌ Advanced error codes/telemetry - Deferred to M4

---

## Performance Characteristics

- **Read Speed**: ~1-2 MB/s (SPI flash limited)
- **Write Speed**: ~500 KB/s (SPI flash + FATFS overhead)
- **Latency**: ~10-50 ms per operation
- **Max File Size**: Limited by SPI flash size (typically 4-16 MB)

---

## Next Steps (M2)

1. Implement USB Host Mode (MSC)
2. Add BOOT1 GPIO-based mode selection
3. Implement file copy from Device to Host
4. Add support for external USB devices
5. Implement partition creation/formatting
